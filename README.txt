This repository is an example of test driven development using Jasmine 2.6.0

The implementation is a binary search algorithm written to the specs described in this code kata http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/.

Jasmine tests are broken into two overall suites: input validation and valid input cases.
